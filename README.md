# Hangman Game

## Overview
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game. The objective is to guess the hidden word one letter at a time before running out of attempts. This implementation of Hangman provides a fun and challenging experience for players of all ages.

## How to Play
1. **Objective**: Guess the hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time.
2. **Gameplay**:
   - The game will display a series of underscores, each representing a letter in the hidden word.
   - The player suggests a letter. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct positions.
   - If the letter is not in the word, the player loses an attempt, and a part of the hangman is drawn.
   - The player wins by guessing all the letters in the word before the hangman is fully drawn.
   - The player loses if the hangman is fully drawn before the word is guessed.

## Features
- Random word selection from a predefined list or external source.
- Visual representation of the hangman and word progress.
- Support for different difficulty levels (optional).
